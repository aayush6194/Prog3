/**
 * Program header and description:
 *
 * A wordPairs class that a given a list of words and following words (vertex and edges connection) reads the file and uses DiGraph class for a
 * adjecency list representation of a graph. Also additonal Word class objects are used to store the node level and node's word chain(word pairs) for each word.
 *   
 * WordPair class uses breadth for search algorithm to reach a required node or a required level of nodes as per the method that calls the bfs method.
 * Also, to find of the nodes in a certain level a Level map is used that takes int (level of the word) and word class object to store nodes (alphabetically) in a set 
 * per the level of the node. Map key is traversed by a for loop to retrive elements in each level.
 * To find of the stortest word chain or chain length till a certain node is traversed, a wordMap map is used that takes string (name of the word) and word class object to store chain  in as a string.
 * Chain is stored as string and not array to aviod passing an array per every word(node) as argument(because of java's type checking).
 * Additonally, a visted set is used to keep track of the visted node. 
 * The chain string is retrived by updating a globalChain varible by bfs method, it is reset before each use to aviod any stale data.
 * To use a common bfs method for each method, it uses diffrent arguments to target a required data.
 * String last is pass as null if the method does not require finding an element
 * int maxLevel is pass as -1 if the method does not require reaching a certain level in the graph
